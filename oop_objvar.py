# Here, population belongs to the Robot class and hence is a class variable.
# The name variable belongs to the object (it is assigned using self ) and
# hence is an object variable.

# Thus, we refer to the population class variable as Robot.population and not
# as self.population . We refer to the object variable name using self.name
# notation in the methods of that object.

# Also note that an object variable with the same name as a class variable will
# hide the class variable!

# Instead of Robot.population we could have also used self.__class__.population
# because every object refers to itâ€™s class via the self.__class__ attribute.
